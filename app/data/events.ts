We have found that the performance of these models consistently improve with more reinforcement learning compute and with more inference compute. The latest model, o3, surpasses previous state-of-the-art models in a variety of benchmarks that require reasoning, including mathematics competitions, programming contests, and advanced science question sets. I will discuss the implications of scaling this paradigm even further.`,

    descriptionHtml: `
      <p>I will lead a live demonstration of the "Somers System" of land valuation in which a moderator gathers together a group of people and gets them to collectively value land in their local jurisdiction.</p>
      <p>I'll need either a laptop and projector, or else just a big paper map on the wall. I'll start by asking "What's the most valuable stretch of street in Berkeley?" Someone will give an answer.</p>
      <p>I'll write down 100 right there.</p>
      <p>Then I'll say, "What's the NEXT most valuable stretch of street in Berkeley?" Someone else will give an answer. I'll ask, "How much is it worth, RELATIVE to Berkeley?" They'll give some number, say 95%. I'll write down 95.</p>
      <p>And so on until we've filled up the whole thing.</p>
      <p>Then I'll explain how the historical Georgist movement relied on a method just like this to value land. It was used in lots big American cities for decades, including Cleveland, Colombus, Baltimore, Houston, and even New York City.</p>
      <p>Will it work? Who knows! The purpose of this demonstration is to test it out with a real audience. People should bet on the outcome in advance!</p>

This talk explores a groundbreaking peer prediction mechanism from the 2016 paper Paying for Truth by Rigol and Roth, which incentivizes truthful evaluations even in tight-knit communities. By connecting this to insights from Talent by Tyler Cowen and Daniel Gross, the talk reveals how organizations can combine structured incentives with insider intuition to surface exceptional people. Drawing on real-world applications from the Church of the Infinite Game, you’ll learn how tools like Bayesian truth serum, quadratic voting, red teaming, and ritualized feedback loops can help any organization grow fast without losing clarity, culture, or coherence.',

From the early days of Intrade and PredictIt to today’s breakout platforms like Manifold, Polymarket, and Kalshi, each wave has expanded the reach and relevance of event markets.

Now, a convergence of factors—regulatory tailwinds, institutional interest, and breakthroughs in market microstructure—points toward a future where event futures sit alongside commodity derivatives as core tools for hedging policy risk and allocating capital.

This talk explores what it will take for prediction markets to move from billions to quadrillions in annual volume, and what that means for investors, traders, policymakers, and builders looking to embrace, enjoy, and profit from this inevitable and imminent asymptotic moment.`,
