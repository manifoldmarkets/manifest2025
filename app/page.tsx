              <>
                Manifest is in the lineage of Manifold. This year, we're really excited about bringing together people who forecast the future, care about the future going well, and who build an interesting future. The crowd is dynamic, open, and draws from more than just one community. While there are the familiar internet subcultures, Manifest is not any one thing and people come from tech, trading, forecasting, writing, and prediction markets. It should be quite fun!
